INTRODUCTION 
-----------------

* This game sample was made to understand the proper structure in web aplications using the basic tools (HTML, CSS, JS). 

* To navigate use your up, down, left and right keys. Make sure to stay away from the walls, and DO NOT go in on yourself

* In this project I learned the structure of JavaScript and how to properly intergrate the language within it's respective field. Another version of this game will be created in Vue.js with more features

* Plans for this game: 
    - Upgrading UX/UI
    - Integrate a scoreboard/database

THANKS FOR PLAYING!
